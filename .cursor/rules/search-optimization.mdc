# Search Query Optimization Guidelines

## Query Construction Best Practices
- Use specific, focused queries rather than broad terms
- Include relevant keywords for the intended domain/topic
- For news searches, include temporal context (recent, current, today)
- Use location qualifiers when searching for regional content

## Parameter Selection Strategy

### Search Depth
- **Basic**: Fast, generic results (1 API credit)
- **Advanced**: Higher relevance, better content extraction (2 API credits)
- Use advanced for important queries, basic for exploratory searches

### Topic Selection
- **general**: Default for most searches
- **news**: For current events, recent developments  
- **finance**: For market data, economic news
- **health**: For medical, wellness content
- **scientific**: For research, academic content
- **travel**: For tourism, destination information

### Content Enhancement
- `include_answer="advanced"`: For comprehensive AI summaries
- `include_raw_content="markdown"`: For full article content
- `max_results=10-20`: For thorough research
- `chunks_per_source=3`: For detailed content extraction (advanced only)

## Common Anti-Patterns to Avoid
- Setting both start_date and end_date to the same value
- Using country filter for international news coverage
- Requesting raw content without considering response size
- Ignoring API credit costs for high-volume applications

## Fallback Strategies
1. Start with advanced search for important queries
2. Fall back to basic search if credit constraints exist
3. Retry with broader terms if no results found
4. Use different time ranges for temporal searches
5. Remove domain restrictions if results are limited

## Result Quality Indicators
- Check response.answer for AI-generated summaries
- Monitor relevance scores in results
- Validate published_date for news content
- Review failed_results for extraction issues
